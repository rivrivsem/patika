    What is Random Forest Algorithm?

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines decision trees to create a more powerful model.
 An ensemble is a collection of multiple models that work together to produce a better result than any
 single model could. In the case of Random Forest, the algorithm combines multiple decision trees to create a
  final model that is more accurate than any single decision tree.

How does Random Forest Algorithm work?

Random Forest algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees from random subsets of the
 data and then combining the results from all of these trees to produce a final result. Each decision tree
  is built using a random subset of the features, and each tree makes its own prediction based on the
  data it has seen. The final prediction is made by taking the average of the predictions made by all
   the decision trees.

Why is Random Forest Algorithm so widely used in Data Science?

Random Forest algorithm is widely used in data science because of its ability to handle a large number
 of features, reduce overfitting, and produce accurate results. The algorithm is able to handle a large
 number of features by building multiple decision trees, each one looking at a different subset of the
 features. This helps to prevent overfitting, which is a common problem in machine learning where a model becomes too complex and fits the training data too well, but fails to generalize to new data. The algorithm also produces accurate results because it combines the results from multiple decision trees, making it less likely to make a mistake.

In conclusion, Random Forest algorithm is a powerful tool in data science that combines the results from multiple decision trees to create a final model that is more accurate than any single decision tree. It is widely used because of its ability to handle a large number of features, reduce overfitting, and produce accurate results. If you are working in data science, understanding how Random Forest works and why it is so widely used is a must.
